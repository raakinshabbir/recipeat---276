## 1. Overview of Iteration 1
For Iteration 1, we focused on establishing the main features and structure of the app while familiarizing ourselves with the Ruby on Rails MVC framework. Our goals included delivering:
- A solid application foundation
- Database integration
- A responsive UI
- Secure user authentication
- Version control

We spent significant time setting up the Ruby on Rails environment, linking web pages, and learning to use Git collaboratively, which greatly improved our ability to merge and integrate work.

## 2. Accomplishments
During this iteration, the team successfully completed:
- **Feature Tracking:** We utilized Jira and Kanban principles to track issues and assign tasks.
- **Retrospective Document:** This document serves to reflect on our accomplishments and challenges.
- **Version Control/Git Repository:** Successfully set up a Git repository with appropriate branching for features and individual work.
- **Testing:** Conducted meticulous UI testing to ensure components routed correctly and user authentication was valid.
- **Feature Implementation:** Began implementing key functional requirements:
  - **Welcome Page:** A page welcoming users and prompting sign-in or sign-up.
  - **Login Page:** User sign-in functionality.
  - **Swiping Recipes:** Users can swipe left or right on sample recipes with feedback messages.
  - **Add Recipes:** Framework for users to add their own recipes is in progress.
  - **Liked Recipes:** Framework for users to view their liked recipes is in progress.

## 3. What Went Well?
Positive aspects of this iteration included:
- Regular team meetings every few days facilitated collaboration on implementation.
- Efficient learning of Bootstrap for creating HTML elements like buttons and navbars.
- The Kanban board in Jira was effective for visualizing task delegation and ensuring accountability.

## 4. Challenges Encountered
Challenges faced during this iteration included:
- Frequent merge conflicts when pulling or switching branches, as we were new to collaborative Git usage.
- Difficulty interpreting each other's code due to limited experience in a full-stack environment, causing confusion and slow progress.

## 5. Areas for Improvement
To enhance our next iteration, we identified the following areas for improvement:
- Adding comments in the code and providing more detailed Git commit messages to give context.
- Implementing a code review process prior to merging branches to identify potential issues early and improve overall code quality.
